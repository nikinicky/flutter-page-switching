# flutter-page-switching

> This repository was created to complete an assignment for my *Mobile Development* subject.

This is a basic Flutter app designed for learning activity navigation in Android. The app allows users to switch between pages, such as navigating from the **main page** to **Page 1** and back.

## Here are some screenshots of the app in action:
